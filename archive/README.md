# Archive

This directory contains historical documentation and process artifacts preserved for reference but excluded from the active pipeline.

## Contents

- **Historical Process Documentation**: Implementation summaries, refactor notes, testing fixes
- **Milestone Checklists**: Original submission checklists
- **Build Artifacts**: Old evidence tarballs, coverage snapshots

These files document the development journey but are not required for understanding or running the current system. For active documentation, see the root `README.md` and `docs/` directory.
